A Stealth Action game with love2d
Game development blog: http://ring0dev.blogspot.ca

How To:
Please get love2d at https://love2d.org according to your platform.
Drag the repository folder to the application to run the game.
Under UNIX environment, use the repository as the first parameter of the executable.

This is a WIP. There is no in-game help yet, so there's a list of features you can try out once you hit START GAME in the menu.

- you can press Q to view your inventory.
- you can press L to activate/deactive Low Latency Inhibition vision.
- you can press P to call out editor. The changes in editor will be reflected right away. You will be able to save/load the entire game state. (In fact a level is a exisiting game state)
- once you switch into weapon, you can press right mouse button to use them. Right now only gun and syringe is somewhat functioning.

Note regarding Low Latency Inhibition vision:
- you will be able to see through objects
- you will be able to see how much noise your action is going to create. (Red circle for highly alerting attention, Yellow circle for mild attention)

AI only responds to sound for now so it does not matter if you pull out weapons in front of them.

This project is not currently under development. We are trying to get back on this during Summer.
